<h1>Web Mapping</h1>
<h2>ArcGIS Hosting</h2>
<p>
    The first time i tried to brring Geodata into the web was quite cumbersome 
    because i just started programming and knew nothing of Web Development. 
    I opted for a hosted solution which could be integrated easily in every Website with an iframe. 
    There are many such services and the Esri servers are by far not the best. 
    Services like Carto or Mapbox offer a Geodata Hosting environment with 
    a UI streamlined for non-coding users. Additionally Map Styling Editors 
    are quite elaborate and allow for every kind of adjustment. 
    Mapbox also convinces with beautiful Basemaps of their own making.
</p>
<div class="embed-container map-container" >
    <iframe 
        frameborder="0" 
        scrolling="no" 
        marginheight="0" 
        marginwidth="0" 
        title="Trade Routes of ancient Arabia" 
        src="//www.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=394b5ddec04c44208b28838d3daf3d9d&extent=32.1798,23.6323,48.4066,31.7635&zoom=true&previewImage=false&scale=true&disable_scroll=true&theme=light">
    </iframe>
</div>
<p>
    Here i opted for the bare minimum, styling-wise, and also didnt refine the data very much. 
    I am currently in the process of publishing the thesis as a monography which led to 
    massively improved paper maps but reworking the webhosted data us currently not part of the plan.
</p>
<h2>Geonode Hosting</h2>
<p>
    Another way is to host your own infrastructure. 
    My last employer, the German Archaeological Institute, maintains an instance of Geonode for its own excavations, see example below
</p>
<div class="map-container">
    <iframe src="https://geoserver.dainst.org/maps/5548/embed"></iframe>
</div>
<h2>Leaflet</h2>
<p>
    Once one has taken the step into actually writing code one has a few choices. 
    Leaflet is considered the most accessible library for Webmapping. 
    To build a very basic map only very few lines of code are needed.
    Below you find an example i built for a Freelance Job - a website accompanying an 
    exhibition about an early-modern city wall surrounding Berlin
</p>
<div id="Leaflet_map" class="map-container"></div>
<script type="module">
    import { loadLeafletMap } from './akzisemauer.js'
    loadLeafletMap()
</script>

<p>
    There is certain styling, certain customisation of default elements like 
    the controls and the popup boxes and some interactivity. The checkboxes in the lower 
    left activate overlays of georeferenced digitised paper maps hosted on a tile server here.
    Leaflet clearly provides enough tools to built a nice presentation but reaches its limits with complex interactions.
</p>
<h2>OpenLayers</h2>
<p>OpenLayers on the other hand is loaded with functions but more complex to handle. Consider this implementation of one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/shaded-relief.html">official examples</a>.</p>

<div id="ol-map" class="map-container"></div>
<script type="module">
    import { loadOLHillshadeMap } from './ol-hillshade.js'
    loadOLHillshadeMap()
</script>

<table class="controls">
    <tr>
        <td><label for="vert">vertical exaggeration:</label></td>
        <td><input id="vert" type="range" min="1" max="5" value="1"/></td>
        <td><span id="vertOut"></span> x</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><label for="sunEl">sun elevation:</label></td>
        <td><input id="sunEl" type="range" min="0" max="90" value="45"/></td>
        <td><span id="sunElOut"></span> °</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><label for="sunAz">sun azimuth:</label></td>
        <td><input id="sunAz" type="range" min="0" max="360" value="45"/></td>
        <td><span id="sunAzOut"></span> °</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    It generates a hillshade from a DEM. Meaning it takes a Digital Elevation 
    Model (DEM) and calculates the shadowfall given a certain position of the sun. 
    The parameters to define the suns position are linked to the 3 sliders and the 
    calculation is updated whenever on of the sliders is used.
    Quite elaborated geoprocessing yet completely client-sided. Impressive.</p>
