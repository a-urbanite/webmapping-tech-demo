<h2>ArcGIS Hosting</h2>
<p>
  The first time i tried to bring Geodata into the web was quite cumbersome because i just started programming
  and knew nothing of Web Development. I opted for a hosted solution which could be integrated easily in every
  Website with an iframe. There are many such services and the Esri servers are by far not the best. Services
  like Carto or Mapbox offer a Geodata Hosting environment with a UI streamlined for non-coding users.
  Additionally Map Styling Editors are quite elaborate and allow for every kind of adjustment. Mapbox also
  convinces with beautiful Basemaps of their own making.

<div class="map-container">
  <iframe
    src="//www.arcgis.com/apps/Embed/index.html?webmap=394b5ddec04c44208b28838d3daf3d9d&extent=32.1798,23.6323,48.4066,31.7635&zoom=true&previewImage=false&scale=true&disable_scroll=true&theme=light"
  ></iframe>
</div>

  Here i opted for the bare minimum, styling-wise, and also didnt refine the data very much. I am currently in
  the process of publishing the thesis as a monography which led to massively improved paper maps but
  reworking the webhosted data us currently not part of the plan.
