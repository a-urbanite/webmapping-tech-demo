<h2>Leaflet</h2>
<p>
  Once one has taken the step into actually writing code the fun starts. Leaflet is considered the most
  accessible library for Webmapping. To build a very basic map only very few lines of code are needed. Below
  you find an example i built for a Freelance Job - a
  <a target="blank" href="http://www.akzisemauer-berlin.de/">website</a> accompanying an exhibition about an
  early-modern city wall surrounding Berlin
</p>
<div id="Leaflet_map" class="map-container"></div>
<script type="module">
  import { loadLeafletMap } from "./segments/akzisemauer.js";
  loadLeafletMap();
</script>

<p>
  There is certain styling, certain customisation of default elements like the controls and the popup boxes
  and some interactivity. The checkboxes in the lower left activate overlays of georeferenced digitised paper
  maps hosted on a tile server here. Leaflet is the best choice when one wants to quickly and easily map some
  features. It reaches its limits when manipulation of data in the sense of geoprocessing is desired.
